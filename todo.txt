Cargo stations in networks

Make train length dependent on engine power
Use station-crossing-crossing-station distance to estimate route length vs. distance
Internal: make tasks possibly optional: failure doesn't fail previous subtasks

Inline stations:
- don't open up the ongoing line until completed, or trains (unable to turn around) may already be on the track
- narrower search field for next town, maybe shorter?
- needs reserved tiles around town - manhattan distanc square area?
